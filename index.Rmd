# Preface {-}

This workbook is a general instruction guide for analysts on how to make their Excel worksheets dynamic. This will prevent you from having to copy and paste data, formulas, and update charts. It will also reduce the number of errors and the time it takes to update data in Excel.

There are four chapters, each for a method of automating the spreadsheet.

1. Chart auto update
2. Set constant baseline period in chart
3. Add a record to a table when there is new data in the data sheet
4. Automatically update the table or chart title when the table has been updated

Example Excel workbooks have also been created and are linked to in the individual chapters when they are used.
