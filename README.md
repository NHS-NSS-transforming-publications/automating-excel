# Automating Excel

*An instruction guide on how to make Excel worksheets dynamic.*

This is a Bookdown guide for analysts on how to make their Excel worksheets dynamic. This will prevent you from having to copy and paste data, formulas, and update charts. It will also reduce the number of errors and the time it takes to update data in Excel.

There are currently four sections:

1. Chart auto-update
2. Setting a constant baseline period in a chart
3. Adding a record to a table where there is new data in a data sheet
4. Automically updating the table or chart title when the table has been update.

This is part of the Transforming Publishing team's [toolkit](https://github.com/NHS-NSS-transforming-publications/Toolkit) of templates, guides, and resources. If you have any questions (or suggestions) about the toolkit or this guidance then please contact our team at [nss.isdtransformingpublishing@nhs.net](mailto:nss.isdtransformingpublishing@nhs.net) and we'd be more than happy to help.
